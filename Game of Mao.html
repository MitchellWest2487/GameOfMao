      <div class="section" id="about">
        <h1>Intro</h1>
        <p style="color:#CF0">Mao is the greatest card game in existence.</p>
        <p style="color:#F0A">To play Mao, you need a group of awesome people and one deck of cards per 3-4 people in the group (a minimum of two decks).</p>
        <p style="color:#CF0">The goal of Mao is to get rid of all of your cards.</p>
        <p style="color:#F0A">To play a card, it must match the suit or rank of the active card (the last card played).</p>
        <p style="color:#CF0">Jokers (if you choose to use them) may only be played on top of face cards and have no effect on the active suit.  You may not two-it a Joker.</p>
        <h1>Starting</h1>
        <p>To begin a game of Mao, one player is chosen as the dealer.  The dealer then deals each player seven cards.  Other players may not touch any cards before the game begins; doing so results in a penalty.  The dealer then names a player and a direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise), turns over the top card of the deck, and the game begins.</p>
        <h1>Penalties</h1>
        <p>The heart of Mao lies in its dynamic <span class="navlink" onclick="toggleSection(&#39;#rules&#39;);">Rules</span> and avoiding the penalties for breaking them.  Any time a player breaks one of the rules, it is up to the other players to catch it.  They must then say "penalty for", followed by an explanation of the action that broke the rule (but not necessarily the rule itself).  The player must then take one card as their penalty.
        </p><h1>Point of Order</h1>
        <p>A player may call "point of order" at any point during the game.  All players must immediately put their hand down; you may not touch any cards besides the draw stack and discard pile.  During a Point of Order, all verbal rules are suspended (unless specified otherwise).  A Point of Order may only be ended by the person that started it saying "end point of order".</p>
        <h1>Winning the Game</h1>
        <p>To win a game of Mao, a player must play their last card without breaking any rules and say "Mao", unless the last card is a Jack, in which case they must say "Mao Mao".  If they fail to do this, or break any other rules during the play, they must draw one card, take back their winning card, and forfeit their turn.</p>

      <div class="section" id="rules">
        <div class="rule" id="thanks">
          <h2 class="hasNotes">Where Are Your Manners?</h2>
          <p>Any time you receive a penalty, you must thank the player that gave it to you.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>This rule can be applied repeatedly as long as there is no thank you.</li>
            <li>In cases where a player receives multiple penalties at once, one thank you suffices.</li>

        <div class="rule" id="drawtwo">
          <h2>Have A Nice Day</h2>
          <p>Sevens cause the next player to draw two cards and lose their turn.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule" id="reverse">
          <h2>About-Face</h2>
          <p>Eights reverse the direction of play.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule" id="wilds">
          <h2 class="hasNotes">Wild Boys</h2>
          <p>Jacks are wild cards.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A suit must be called before the card is placed, otherwise any player can call out the suit.</li>
            <li>The first suit called is active.  A player may not change their mind.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="rule" id="joker">
          <h2 class="hasNotes">Joke's On You</h2>
          <p>A Joker may be played to divert any card-induced draw, forcing all players to draw their contribution to the draw total.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Joker may not be played to divert any penalty draw or any draw caused by another Joker.</li>
            <li>Example: If a Joker is used to break a Seven chain, each player must draw two cards for every Seven they played.</li>
            <li>When used for this purpose, a Joker may be played on top of any other card.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="rule" id="pofo">
          <h2 class="hasNotes">What Order?</h2>
          <p>Players can trigger a Point of Order by saying "point of order".  See notes.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Players must lay down their cards and not touch them during a Point of Order.</li>
            <li>Verbal rules are suspended during a Point of Order (notably: the no questions rule).</li>
            <li>A Point of Order can only be ended by the person who started it.</li>

        </div>
        <div class="rule" id="noquestions">
          <h2 class="hasNotes">Wh- Nevermind.</h2>
          <p>Players may not ask any questions.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>This includes questions unrelated to the game.</li>

        <div class="rule" id="ofspades">
          <h2>Blank of Spades</h2>
          <p>The rank of the card followed by "of Spades" must be announced when playing any Spade.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule" id="onecard">
          <h2 class="hasNotes">Last Chance</h2>
          <p>A player must announce "one card" any time their hand dwindles to one card.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Example: If a player with one card drew a card and was able to play it immediately,<br>they would have to call "one card" again.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="rule" id="twoit">
          <h2 class="hasNotes">Do It Two It</h2>
          <p>A card that matches both suit and rank of the current card may be played out of turn by announcing "two-it".</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Play continues in the same direction but from the player that two-it'd.</li>
            <li>If there are more than two decks in play, this rule extends to "three-it", etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="rule" id="stackingsevens">
          <h2 class="hasNotes">Accumulation Sensation</h2>
          <p>Instead of drawing cards from a Seven, a player may play another Seven and pass the cumulative burden on to the next player.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The draw total is added; a run of three sevens would result in a player drawing six cards.</li>
            <li>Works in conjunction with Two-It as well.</li>
          </ul>

        <h1>Advanced Rules</h1>
        <p>In the advanced form of Mao, any time a player wins a round they get to add a new rule to the game.  The rule can be anything, as long as it is completely unbiased.  They do not have to tell the other players what the rule is, but in some cases it would be wise to.  Here is a collection of some favorite rules to implement.</p>
